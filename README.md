# Jimmy Wrangler, Data Explorer

EECS 731: Intrdocution to Data Science, programming assignment 1.

I choose to investigate trends in bitcoin market price history. See the jupyter notebook `notebooks/JW.ipynb` for a walk-through of my process, code, and visualization. See `requirements.txt` for the prerequisite python packages. `src/JW.py` includes all the
code in the notebook, without any commentary or plots. Finally, `data` contains the
"csv"s used for this project, obtained from Kaggle.

## On Github's notebook view
It seems the notebook does not load when viewed on Github. However, it works when viewed locally.
